  <h1>Ukraine-russia, - Patriotic liberation war in the centre of Europe or the beginning of the Third World War?</h1>
   <p>Hi, now in my country Ukraine there is a war! People die heroically defending the ideals of the Free World! 
      There is an air raid alert in my city again and I'm sitting in a shelter! 
      Air raid, it's creepy in the basement and time goes slowly, it seems that it is stop! 
      I have the opportunity to write a cry from my Soul in continuation of the post 
      https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59390061#msg59390061 
      Dear friends, crypto enthusiasts, unfortunately, it's a bad time and instead of crypto coins, 
      I now want to write on bitcointalk only about the war in Ukraine, my home country, which I love very much! I know Ukraine will win and be a free country! 
      Regarding the above post, I want to say: Based on experience, I can say that you do not need special skill in managing a charitable foundation to help your city! 
      Thank God! There are many merciful people in the World doing God's pleasing deeds! 
      Not indifferent people of the planet, want to save the lives of Ukrainian people! 
      One only needs to say to these wonderful people how they can help the Ukrainians! 
      Good people, not standing aside from the war, donate their funds and call through social networks to donate to the Ukrainians! 
      People know that civilians in Ukraine are being shot, shelled, bombed, their houses are on fire, they and their children are bleeding!  
      Those people who themselves donate funds do not ask to publish reports, photos of the work done or checks! 
      People provide help at the behest of their Heart, expressing their sympathy for the Ukrainians, do not demand anything in return! 
      Here are a few official, state funds of Ukraine collecting help with cryptocurrency:  
       https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/uk/donate  
       https://bank.gov.ua/ua/about/support-the-armed-forces   
       https://thedigital.gov.ua/news/ofitsiyni-kriptogamantsi-kudi-mozhna-perekazati-groshi-dlya-armii-ukraini 
       https://razomforukraine.org/donate/ https://voices.org.ua/en/donat/ 
       https://novaukraine.org/donate/ https://my.kuna.io/en/kunaid-ukraine 
       https://nation.io/dao/ukraine https://ain.ua/2022/02/28/yak-pidtrimati-armiyu-u-kriptovalyuti/ 
       https://t.me/CyberpolUA/1069 https://savelife.in.ua/en/donate/ 
       https://twitter.com/Ukraine/status/1497594592438497282  
      The collected cryptocurrency by the State Funds is connected to the conversion process of the FTX and KUNA exchanges. 
      The exchange converts crypto currency into fiat, dollar or UAH and sends it to the accounts of the Ministry of Digital Development or the National Bank of Ukraine. 
      However, many people in the World, doubting the effectiveness of their help, because of the negative image of corrupt officials in Ukraine! 
      Therefore, many people prefer to provide charitable assistance not to large, impersonal, official state funds, but through ordinary people (people's volunteers, relatives or ordinary caring people on the ground)! People want to help a particular city/region or even individually: a person, a family, a community. 
      In support of the above, here is a quote: I am sure that the Ukrainian government is corrupt and oppressed many people within its borders for various reasons, by the way, 
      so I would not donate to their official BTC addresses or anything like that.  
      https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382794.msg59474469#msg59474469  
      Concerning the fears spread by about massive fundraising scams! 
      I will say this: against the general background of volunteers and good people, there are only a few scoundrels, and they do not have a significant impact on the desire of good people to help other good people! 
      Most people who help are very reasonable! Comparing the risks between fraudulent fundraising and saving people's lives, people unambiguously choose to help Ukrainians! 
      After all, even a little help can save someone a big life! 
      At a minimum, doing good deeds, people put a huge plus on their Karma! In other words, our deeds ripen according to the principle “what we sow, we will reap”: 
      good deeds will respond with good, evil ones will turn into evil! I think this: 
      Who wants to help he will help, and who does not want will find a reason to refuse! 
      I am 60 years old, in 1986, I saw the evil face of Atomic Chernobyl and I dare to say that even more Evil has come to Ukraine!

      If you want to feel what most Ukrainians felt a few hours ago, watch these videos...

      the power of Airborne Vacuum Bombs and rockets is terrifying even if you are just a spectator, these just those moments in life when you want to be away from all this. 
      And here is what the author of another post wrote: Imagine that one day you wake up and see that your house came under artillery fire, 5 members of your family were killed, 
      you were forced to become refugees, not knowing if you would ever return to the country, which they have called home all their lives. 
      I'll add from myself https://youtu.be/ICCuzCTLuMQ 
      I warn you it's impossible to watch without tears! 
      Destroyed houses, shelling of the hospital and maternity hospital, crying mothers! 
      For example, the author of the post  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59396947#msg59396947 wrote: 
      I survived a bloody war and I know perfectly well what it means when grenades and air bombs fall around, and you every for a moment you wonder if it will hit you too. 
      Your country is now in the same situation as mine was in 1991, when Serbian executioners set out to demolish and kill everything in front of them, sparing neither small children nor pregnant women. 
      In Ukraine, the Patriotic War is going on and it is fighting not only for itself, but for the entire civilized World! 
      Dear friends, if I did not convince the need to help the Ukrainians, at least in an amount that would not cause tangible damage to your personal well-being, then further convictions lose their meaning! As they say: God is your Judge! But if today you stand aside from grief in Ukraine, then do not be surprised if tomorrow you see the enemy at your gates! 
      I want to reply to the author of the post https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5387774.msg59390760#msg59390760  
      Dear franky1! You asked if there are any local businesses that deliver in an area that accepts bitcoin. 
      And I mean legitimate businesses. (not fake phishing sites created last month) through which people can just buy things on a website where you can host some legitimate shelters/clearing points, physical addresses of hospitals (legitimate charities), etc. and use the delivery address of the shelter / hospital as the destination of the goods, so that they can then be delivered directly to the shelters / hospitals.  Dear franky1! As for "non-fake phishing sites created last month" 
      I will say this: Phishing was relevant for peacetime and reasoning over a cup of coffee under a sky without bombs! 
      In war, other criteria of truth work! 
      Ukraine did not believe that Russia would attack, but the treacherous attack happened! Of course there are new sites for collecting donations! 
      They will appear: yesterday, today, tomorrow and every new day, and this is good for Ukrainians and victory! 
      This does not mean at all that these sites are phishing! It rather means that more good people want to help other good people! What are the benefits of cryptocurrencies for donations? Cryptocurrency is not a replacement for traditional donations “it’s an additional fundraising tool.” 
      For volunteers who collect donations for the army, this is important, because some financial organizations equate their activities with "support for violence." 
      For example, on the first day of russia’s invasion of Ukraine, February 24, fundraising platform Ptatreon removed the page of the Turn Back Alive foundation, explaining that it “does not allow the funds raised on the platform to be used to support violence or purchase military equipment.” 
      Compared to bank transfers, it has several advantages: It's fast and easy. Organizations do not need to spend time opening a bank account and verifying; transfers are made almost instantly, unlike SWIFT transactions, which can take several days. According to Mr. Chobanyan (owner of the Ukrainian exchange KUNA), even if the banking system goes out, people know how to convert cryptocurrency into cash and vice versa. So, thanks to the crypt, it will be possible to buy everything you need during the War. 
      Ukrainians saw cryptocurrency as an alternative to public and private financial institutions, which are not trusted in wartime due to the threat of losing funds. 
      Evacuated Ukrainians can transfer funds to crypto, so that later they can safely convert it back to fiat currency already abroad, not risking losing significant amounts due to a depreciation. https://focus.ua/digital/508137-kak-kriptovalyuty-pomogayut-ukraine-i-rossii-vo-vremya-voyny-mneniya-ekspertov 
      Dear "Franky1", I understand your concerns and will try to tell you how you and other merciful people can help Ukrainians, my compatriots! 
      Franky1 thank you and those who help Ukrainians in fight for Freedom! 
      My "step by step" life hack for people who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteers and just caring people in Ukraine: 
      You must learn to choose people who need help immediately (for example medicines)! 
      Also, you need to learn military logistics so that effectively provide assistance! Of course, without knowing the local, military situation, technical and logistical capabilities, this is not easy! 
      I must warn you that in cities that are under siege, destroyed or captured, the chances are minimal, but you have to try (you will learn from correspondence with a person). 
      Therefore, I initially recommended starting to cooperate with state funds, and in case of distrust, with local volunteers or with caring people on the ground! 
      But, I believe that you yourself will learn how to effectively save people without being directly in Ukraine! Here is my "step by step" life hack for people who want to help Ukrainians, but do not trust corrupt officials, volunteers and just caring people in Ukraine: Option Basic Step By Step: 
       1. Register your account on the Ukrainian crypto currency exchange https://kuna.io (you can use Binannce, but there are fewer payment options in UAH) 
       2. Replenish your exchange account with cryptocurrencies (any from the list of the exchange). 
       3. Exchange your crypto coins for UAH! 
       4. Find a city, a community and select the people you want to help in the social chat. 
          For example here: https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/ru/397671-tem-kto-nuzhdaetsya-v-pomocshi-adresa-volonterskih-telegramm-kanalov  
          Example: a person needs insulin or a heart drug, but he was left without money and his house. 
          Find out from this person: price, quantity (preferably for a week, as there are many who need it), the website of the nearest working pharmacy that has medicine and what payment methods are available (there are 4 options in UAH + sometimes in crypto) Cryptocurrencies are allowed in Ukraine. 
       5. Pay for the medicine and tell the Order number to the person! Everything! You My Hero!
       
       Light option Step-By-Step: 
       1. Find a chat group in social networks of a particular city and select the people you want to help or tell them that you want to help. 
          For example here https://ukrainenews.fakty.ua/ru/397671-tem-kto-nuzhdaetsya-v-pomocshi-adresa-volonterskih-telegramm-kanalov find a group of people, 
          example this https://t.me /joinchat/YWL1i8NGX5NhM2My 
       2. Ask a person how much money he needs and for what exactly (better focus on critical positions for life, but this is not necessary)! 
       3. Tell the person that you can donate the equivalent of the amount in cryptocurrency, but you need his crypto wallet (agree on the name of the coin). 
       4. After, transfer coins to the person! 
      The person himself will find where to exchange and buy what he needs! (via: stock exchange, bank, private exchanger)! Everything! You my hero!  
      In the Light version, there is one problem! Very often, people in need do not have a crypto account and do not know how to make it and how it works! 
      Need to explain and teach! Otherwise, they have to turn to outside help for help! 
      Help can be expensive or scam (rare)! 
      Therefore, it is better, easier, more reliable and more efficient to provide assistance through: official state funds, volunteer organizations or people like me! 
      Franky1 and other people who sympathize with Ukraine, if you prefer to provide individual assistance, then you can respond to my call for help and without any fear, 
      give your help by sending cryptocurrency here: 
     
       BTC:   3LH2UDkVdtb5hrmzzXd3mn7F2DMiBDknRQ
       ETH:   0xBC78e5991A678B18c3252e2173aF53fa75302A4f
       USDT:  TTYLYKrFarPxmwNsLkR3d3Jv6EZ7T7eUB2  (TRC20)
       USDC:  0xBC78e5991A678B18c3252e2173aF53fa75302A4f
       DOGE:  D5e4aCTVTxqMY9rxJToyDedpGij4gSTWiG
       LTC:   LQ89BzDyuzoV8xFj2SVBjjDxPaCVwxUK9m
       ZEC:   t1XDdBmyKFKXN8V1CoEFTGHkhabZroAjdii

      You can also create your own charitable mini fund and accumulate on it the funds of your relatives, friends, acquaintances and various human communities 
      (Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Linkedin, in your local social groups, various communities and chats)! 
      There are a lot of people in need, so donations are needed a lot! Some recommendations regarding the collection of donations to the mini fund. 
      I recommend for each community to create separate crypto wallets! 
      Then you can easily determine how many merciful people are registered in a particular social network! If the network has low responsiveness to a call for help, 
      then draw the appropriate conclusion and do not waste your time and the fire of the Soul on communicating with people who do not have compassion! And vice versa, your high activity in social groups with positive responsiveness will do a lot of good deeds pleasing to God and will greatly help ordinary Ukrainians! 
      Ukrainians will be incredibly grateful to you and all kind people!
      Dear Franky1 and other merciful people, if you want to provide one-time assistance to Ukraine, and not become an international volunteer, then it is better, easier, more reliable and more efficient to provide your assistance through: official state funds, volunteer organizations or people like me! 
      So, Franky1 if you want to help the Ukrainians yourself, you have my instructions! 
      Or, if you trust me, you can do the same without any doubt through me! By simply making a transfer to any of the following crypto wallets: Convincing request to all not indifferent people! Please repost this post or link to it as widely as possible! You can shorten the post for the convenience of reposting on social networks! 
      If you just repost this post or send a link to it to your friends, acquaintances and just good people, you will already help Ukrainians in their Fight for Freedom! Thanks in advance to everyone who responds to the call for help and / or repost! 
      Also, to simplify reposts and donations, I posted a web version of this post with crypto wallets and their QR codes, link: 
       
      Even if, for some reason, you personally are not ready to provide financial assistance to Ukrainians, then simply reposting this post and sending a link to it or its web version to your friends, acquaintances and just good people on social networks will already help Ukrainians survive in their fight for Freedom and World Peace! 
      Thanks in advance to everyone who responded to the call for help and / or repost!</p>
